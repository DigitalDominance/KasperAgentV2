Vision Our vision for Kasper is to build an inclusive platform that offers equal opportunities for everyone.

By focusing on these core principles, Kasper aims to set a newstandard in the crypto world. Tokenomics Kasper's tokenomics are designed to promote fairness and sustainability. The total supply of Kasper tokens is capped at 28,700,000,000 KASPER. To ensure fair distribution, we had implemented a mint limit of 28,700 KASPER per mint. There were no pre-allocations, which means no tokens were pre-minted or allocated to insiders before the public launch. This approach ensured that all participants had an equal opportunity to acquire tokens. Kasper is focused on benefiting the community by providing equal opportunities for all. Fair Launch and Principles Kasper adheres to a fair launch principle, meaning that no tokens were pre-minted or allocated to insiders before the public launch. This approach ensures a level playing field where all community members have the sameopportunity to acquire tokens from the outset. By avoiding pre-allocations, Kasper promotes transparency and trust within the community. This commitment to fairness aligns with our mission to provide an inclusive and equitable ecosystem for all participants.
